# RFCs


## Final Comment Period (FCP)

### Summary
In Ember governance, subteams make decisions by consensus, and the FCP process means that the subteam members have come to consensus that the conversation has reached a steady state and have come to consensus about the proposed disposition.

### Details
The Ember process is emphatically not based upon voting, but on consensus. Subteams make progress on RFCs they are responsible for through a consensus of the subteam that the discussion on the RFC has reached a "steady state," and the process is not adding any new information.

In general, once the discussion has reached a steady state, there is broad consensus among the participants about what to do. **Consensus does not mean that everyone emphatically agrees with a decision,** but rather than none of the participants is prepared to formally object to a proposed disposition.

Occasionally, an RFC reaches a steady state without a broad consensus of all participants. In this case, a consensus of the subteam members can move the process forward. The assumption is that most conversations will progress to a natural broad consensus naturally, and that the fact that the subteam members can resolve steady-state deadlocks will motivate participants to volunteer new information or propose new compromises.

A subteam initiates the FCP process when:

1. there is a consensus among the subteam members that the conversation has reached a steady state
2. there is a consensus among the subteam members about the disposition of the RFC (merge, reject, postpone)

The intent of the FCP process is to solicit new information, so it's quite common for a final comment period to move the conversation back into contention. If this happens, rinse and repeat. If it doesn't, the proposed disposition takes effect.
