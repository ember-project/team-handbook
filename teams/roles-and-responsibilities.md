# Ember Core Team Member Roles, Responsibilities, and Expectations

## Participation

As a bare minimum, core team members are expected to:

- Follow the community guidelines- https://emberjs.com/guidelines 
- Interact thoughtfully:
    - with the community in an exemplary way - for better or for worse, the “core team” is often perceived as a unit, not as individuals
    - with other members of the core teams in a respectful way (do we need to say this?)
- Participate in maintaining official project libraries
    - Updating dependencies
    - Reviewing PRs
- Attend weekly team meetings
- Be reliable
    - If you say you can do something, do it
    - If you can’t do it (life happens- and we are all volunteers) let the team know


## Annual Commitments

The expectations for participation is that every core team member is expected to participate, in the way(s) that they define for themselves. 

Each team member should define the ways in which they will participate, and will revisit this on an annual basis. This will help to ensure that the core teams continue to challenge ourselves and grow. It will also help us identify what type of core team member we are missing, so we can help ourselves grow a balanced team. 

There are many different ways to participate as a core team member:

- Writing new feature code
- Refactoring old code to improve it
- Writing documentation
- Technical Mentorship
    - Regularly answering questions in chat & on the forum
    - Training new potential maintainers - working to “grow” the next group of Ember core team members
- Speaking about Ember at Conferences and Meetups
- Writing RFCs
- Leading projects (i.e., writing the quest issue, providing project management, hosting strike team calls)

Note: “thought leadership” is not a form of participation. Every core team member is expected to already be capable of this before joining the core team (whether they choose to voice thought leadership or not).  

Lack of participation (either by not defining goals, or not honoring the commitments made) is one of the indicators that alumnization should be considered. However, if goals have been defined, but a team member has a major life event, a sabbatical may be considered. 

## Sabbatical

There are certain types of life events- illness of a family member, moving to a new state/country, starting a new job, even burnout- that may require a core team member to take a brief leave of absence from their team. 

The team member should inform their team and the steering committee of this absence, as well as the length of the absence, which could last up to 3 months. 

(How do we indicate that someone is on sabbatical?)

There are some life events that require a longer, or permanent absence from the core team- in those instances, alumnization should be considered instead.  

## Alumnization

Self-awareness is the preferred method of identifying that it is time to become an alumni. 

If approached about it, an honest and non-aggressive conversation should be permissible to review the data that is necessary to make this decision. It is completely natural that it might be a difficult conversation for some to have, but it is also essential that we each have the necessary fortitude to have it.

If someone is not meeting the responsibilities of a core team member, the steering committee will ask them to either alumnize, or create a time-based plan (no more than three months) for meeting the responsibilities. At the end of the time period, if there has not been sufficient progress, they will be asked to alumnize.
