# Alumni Guidance
There comes a time for many core contributors where they no longer contribute to the project. This culminates in a natural Alumnization point. 

Alumnization is never a punishment or penalty, nor are there any real negative impacts. It’s simply an updating of our roster to be a reflection of reality. Alumni still benefit from the reputation boost of having been on the Core Team, they remain on the website (moved to the Alumni section), and permissions aren’t generally changed (of course, in cases where security is a concern, they may). The specific details of any post-alumnization technical changes happen on the per-core-team level. 


## When should someone Alumnize?
The answer to this is very case-by-case specific, but in general, it’s up to individuals to be honest with themselves about their ability to contribute. It’s also up to each team to be cognizant of who is and isn’t around, so they can plan their work around alumnization and reliable availability.

If someone goes on a planned vacation for three months with a set return point, clearly, not a case for alumnization. If someone will be unavailable for a few months around a major life event, say the birth of a child, again, not necessarily do they need to alumnize, depending on whether or not they plan to return. If someone slowly drifts away from their involvement, hasn’t committed and/or been to a meeting in months, things like that, it’s probably a case for alumnization. 

Historically, folks have also stepped up to alumnize in advance of disconnecting. “I’m getting a new job, and it doesn’t use Ember, and it isn’t really likely that I’ll be around much,” for example, has happened a few times. 

Alumizing allows us to send folks off with a big thank you, and triggers a few specific happenings (see: what happens?).
